# driftlon
Driftlon tries to learn how to predict future professional LoL-players, using the public available ranked games on their private profiles.

The data-fetcher fetches and combines data from multiple sources.
The preprocessor prepares the data and filters unnecessary data points to reduce complexity.
The neural network is an lstm/gruc cell trying to learn the development of a player to predict if their development is similar to that of a professional.

Currently I have no good predictor.
